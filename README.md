# Cryptocurrency Time-Series Analysis

Blockchain and cryptocurrencies are a hot topic lately. Since the whole thing about Blockchain and cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin has also drawn my attention, i thought it's time to make a short tutorials about analysing crypto currencies using Time-Series methods.

For the moment, I will develop in Python using [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/). Find in the [link](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) how to install Jupyter Notebook on your computer. Currently, I am running Jupyter Notebook with [Python](https://www.python.org/) 2.7.13. Please note, you have to install all Python dependencies (Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`)  to make it work. Have fun!
