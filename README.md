# Cryptocurrency Time-Series Analysis

[Blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain) and [cryptocurrencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency) are a hot topic lately. Since the whole thing about Blockchain and cryptocurrencies such as [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/en/), [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) and [Litecoin](https://litecoin.org/) has also drawn my attention, i thought it's time to make a short tutorials about analysing crypto currencies using Time-Series methods.

The data itself comes from [Quandl](https://www.quandl.com/). This tutorial is using free available such as the data of the [GDAX (Global Digital Asset Exchange)](https://www.quandl.com/data/GDAX-GDAX-Global-Digital-Asset-Exchange), the worldâ€™s most popular place to buy and sell bitcoin. If you want to build something close to real-time, you might look for other data sources because GDAX updates only once per day. However, for understanding Time-Series analysis, GDAXs data are sufficient.
