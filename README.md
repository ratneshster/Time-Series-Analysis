# Cryptocurrency Time-Series Analysis

[Blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain) and [cryptocurrencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency) are a hot topic lately. Since the whole thing about Blockchain and cryptocurrencies such as [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/en/), [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) and [Litecoin](https://litecoin.org/) has also drawn my attention, i thought it's time to make a short tutorials about analysing crypto currencies using Time-Series methods.

For the moment, I will develop in Python using [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/). Find in the [link](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) how to install Jupyter Notebook on your computer. Currently, I am running Jupyter Notebook with [Python](https://www.python.org/) 2.7.13. 

All Python dependencies can be found in the requirements file. Simply run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all third party libraries.

Have fun!
