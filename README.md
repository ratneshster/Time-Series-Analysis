# Time-Series Analysis

[Blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain) and [cryptocurrencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency) are a hot topic lately. Since the whole thing about Blockchain and cryptocurrencies such as [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/en/), [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) and [Litecoin](https://litecoin.org/) has also drawn my attention, i thought it's time to make a short tutorials about analysing crypto currencies using Time-Series methods.

## 1. Time-Series Tutorials

#### 001 Compare and Display
Retrieve, compare and display Time-Series data of cryptocurrencies. This tutorial will show you a few basics how to handle Time-Series data using Pandas DataFrame.

#### 002 Pivot Table Visualization
Retrieve, compare, aggregate and visualize Time-Series data of cryptocurrencies using pivot table.

#### 003 Seasonal Decomposition
Calculate Seasonal Decomposition for cryptocurrency Time-Series using moving averages. Please note, this is a naive decomposition. More sophisticated methods should be preferred. In this example the additive model (Y[t] = T[t] + S[t] + e[t]) was applied.

#### 004 Autocorrelation
Compare autocorrelated Time-Series data of Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ethereum.

#### 005 Trends and Cycles
Applying ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average), stochastic cycle model and fourier extrapolation to demonstrate the difference of trend from cycle on cryptocurrency data.<br><br><br>
