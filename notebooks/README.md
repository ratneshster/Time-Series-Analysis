## Cryptocurrency Time-Series Analysis using Jupyter Notebooks

Development focuses on Python using [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/). Find in the [link](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) how to install Jupyter Notebook on your computer. Currently, I am running Jupyter Notebook with [Python](https://www.python.org/) 2.7.13. 

All Python dependencies can be found in the requirements file. Simply run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the main folder to install all third party libraries.
